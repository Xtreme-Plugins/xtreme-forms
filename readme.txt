Lead capture forms with email routing, webhooks, analytics, spam protection, and GDPR tools. Free.

== Description ==

Xtreme Forms is a comprehensive WordPress lead capture and management plugin. Build custom forms, capture leads into a database, route notifications to the right team members, track analytics, and stay GDPR-compliant — all from a clean, fast admin interface.

The free tier is fully featured for most use cases. An optional Pro upgrade unlocks advanced routing, webhook retries, extended analytics, and white-label mode.

* **Drag-and-drop Form Builder** — text, email, phone, select, checkbox, radio, textarea, date, file, hidden fields with per-field conditional logic
* **Lead Inbox** — searchable, filterable lead list with status management (new, read, contacted, converted, archived, spam)
* **Email Notifications** — route notifications to different recipients based on form field values
* **Auto-Responder** — send a branded confirmation email to the lead on submission
* **Email Templates** — reusable templates with merge tags ({{first_name}}, {{form_name}}, etc.)
* **Webhooks** — fire HTTP POST payloads to external URLs on lead capture with delivery logging
* **Analytics Dashboard** — submission trends, conversion rates, top forms, lead source breakdown
* **UTM Tracking** — automatically capture and store UTM parameters with each lead
* **Duplicate Detection** — configurable duplicate suppression by email/phone within a time window
* **Spam Protection** — honeypot, time-gate, reCAPTCHA v3, and keyword blocklist
* **GDPR Tools** — consent checkbox, right to erasure, configurable data retention
* **Activity Timeline** — per-lead event history (submitted, emailed, status changes, notes)
* **Notes** — add internal notes to any lead
* **Tags** — tag and filter leads with custom labels
* **Audit Log** — append-only log of all admin actions
* **Import / Export** — full JSON round-trip export and import
* **Multisite Support** — per-site tables, network-aware activation
* **Gutenberg Block** — embed any form with the Xtreme Forms block (live editor preview)
